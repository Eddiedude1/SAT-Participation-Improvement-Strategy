# SAT-Participation Improvement Strategy

After 2 weeks of learning how to code and learning more about statistical inference I worked on this project.

Looking at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams. Your presentation should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams.

### Dataset
- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat.csv)
- [Dataset: ACT Scores](./data/act.csv)

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

This data gives the average SAT and ACT scores by state, and  participation rates for the graduating class of 2017.
